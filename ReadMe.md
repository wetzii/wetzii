# MY SELF

## I just try to learn Java
I went to a very nice school ;) with really nice people like Fabian.  
I like to make methods without sense.

> Don't believe that the "POS" - Test is easy

## Eclipse Hate
I hate Eclipse IDE because it's stupid. But I have to use it for school. In my opinion the fu##king editor is better.

## Linux
I try to learn Linux. Now I have a dual boot with Windows and Arch. BTW I USE ARCH.  
With Hyprland it looks very beautiful.

I deleted my whole drive on a try.  
But I think it's very funny to install random distros.

## Some Random I like
I like guitars.  
I like motorcycles.  
I like my bed.  
I like my keyboard.  
I like Rescuzilla, he is a goat.  
I like Leberkäse.  
I like Club-Mate.  
I like Red Bull Racing.

## What Languages I learn
+ Java --> main  
+ Python --> sometimes  
+ SQL --> too much  
+ VBA --> too much  
+ JavaScript --> too little

## Random Things I hate
- Snakes  
- Windows  
- VBA  
- BitLocker for no reason  
- Secure Boot  
- RTX 4060  
- Eclipse IDE again...  
- Club-Mate-Zero
